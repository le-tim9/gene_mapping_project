# MATH441_Project_3
#### Code pieces:
- please use the `recombination_visualization.ipynb` to generate the plot for gene locations on chromosomes.
- please use `plots.ipynb` to generate the contour plot and convexity map for convexity analysis.
- the `experiment.ipynb` is intended for the authorâ€™s exploratory analysis and idea testing. Some analyses found in this notebook are not included in the report due to length constraints.
- `solver.ipynb` creates a genome with three chromosomes, generate the distance matrix for genes, calculate the positions for each gene, return the result with total error.

#### Functions (updating):
Here is an ongoing list of functions used for this project:
##### in `functions.py`:
- `calculate_recombination_frequency` calculates the frequency of recombination happening in the chromosomes
