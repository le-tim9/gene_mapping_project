# MATH441_Project_3
#### Code pieces:
- please use the `recombination_visualization.ipynb` to generate the plot for gene locations on chromosomes.
- please use `plots.ipynb` to generate the contour plot and convexity map.
- the `experiment.ipynb` is intended for the authorâ€™s exploratory analysis and idea testing. Some analyses found in this notebook are not included in the report due to length constraints.

#### Functions (updating):
Here is an ongoing list of functions used for this project:
##### in `functions.py`:
- `calculate_recombination_frequency` calculates the frequency of recombination happening in the chromosomes
